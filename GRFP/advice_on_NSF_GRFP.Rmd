# Important proposal elements


## Body of proposal | Objectives

Consider a two-step approach

1. "The overall goal of this study is to..."  

2. "Specifically, I will test the following three hypotheses..."


## Body of proposal | Objectives

* Begin with general questions

> - End with specific hypotheses/predictions

> - Avoid statements like "will be different" or "will show a pattern"


## Body of proposal | Materials & methods

* Use enough detail that a reader could essentially duplicate the study (or envision it accurately)

> - Provide important details & omit irrelevant ones

> - Sub-headings can be a useful way to organize the section (eg, "Field study", "Data analysis")


## Body of proposal | Outreach, communication & engagement  

Two levels engagement to consider:

1. Scientific community

2. General public


## Outreach & communication | Scientific community

* Papers and conferences are the standard means

> - Graphical abstracts, videos, and social media are becoming increasingly popular


## Outreach & communication | General public

* "Broader impacts" strengthen the relationship between the science community and society

* This is an increasingly important aspect of grant proposals


## Broader Impacts | Evaluation criteria at NSF

What is the potential for the proposed activity to benefit society or advance desired societal outcomes?

> - Match your strategy to the target community

> - For example, if you are planning for outreach at elementary schools, you will need to package your research into products children can understand.


## Broader Impacts | Evaluation criteria at NSF

To what extent do the proposed activities suggest and explore creative, original or potentially transformative concepts?

> - Describe how you will expand on known, effective strategies and give examples of successful ones

> - For example, hands-on, project-based learning enhances student performance, increases motivation and engagement, and develops critical thinking.


## Broader Impacts | Evaluation criteria at NSF

Is the plan for carrying out the proposed activities well-reasoned, well-organized and based on sound rationale?

> - Develop your Broader Impacts plan in the same way you develop the rationale for your research activities, including an evaluation plan.

> - For example, how will you gauge the success of engaging an elementary school audience?


## Broader Impacts | Evaluation criteria at NSF

How well qualified is the individual (institution) to conduct the proposed activities?

> - Play to your strengths

> - For example, if you have a talent for creating games, perhaps you could create a game about a food web that exemplifies your research on the interaction of different fish species.

> - Think outside the box

> - For example, perhaps there is someone in the education department that would make a good collaborator.


## Broader Impacts | Evaluation criteria at NSF

Are there adequate resources available to carry out the proposed activities?

> - Make sure to describe what resources you have

> - Make sure to budget for broader impacts activities
