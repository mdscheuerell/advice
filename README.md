# Advice for prospective students

Here is some friendly advice for students seeking opportunities for graduate school, which are based on real experiences I have had.

## Names & titles

This might sound obvious, but make sure you have spelled the prospective advisor's name correctly. It's a big turn-off when the first thing you read is your misspelled name. Before you push "send" on your email, check your spelling again.

Prospective advisors have worked hard to earn their degree(s) and they deserve the professional courtesy of referring to them as "Dr." or "Professor". Although using "Mr./Mrs./Ms."  may seem formal, it falls a bit short in this case.
